            YGLF is a 2-day event. Days start at 8:30am with breakfast and a friendly gathering. Talk sessions last 30 minutes, except the longer keynotes and a few other surprises along
            the day :)
        </p>
        <p class="w33 left">
            Of course, a wealthy lunch, refreshing coffee breaks and quality beers are served throughout the day to make it
            extra fun!

                        <p class="event-description">The web was originally imagined to be a simple
                            distributed document retrieval system. It is now being used for applications
                            that go far beyond the system's original capabilities and intentions.
                            We have found ways to make it work,
                            but they are difficult and far too fragile.
                            Many times companies have offered to replace
                            the web with superior proprietary systems, but we rejected them.
                            We have been adding features to the web, but this does little to correct the deep underlying deficiencies, increasing instead of reducing its complexity.
                            This talk suggests a way forward,
                            taking inspiration from our successful transition from NTSC to HDTV.
                            There is a way forward to a web that is safer, easier, and as good as we desire.</p>
