      YGLF is a community event made by developers, for developers. 
      In being so it provides an unmatched opportunity for a connection between the great 
      Israeli frontend community and the companies that help shape the web.
      There's still room for partners to join us in contributing to this year's event, 
      helping us make sure we reach the highest standards of content and quality.
