      Set in the sunny city of Tel-Aviv YGLF is a community event made by developers, for developers. 
      This non-profit conference is aimed at delivering high quality content about relevant topics that any FrontEnd 
      lover would die to hear. Bringing in internationally recognized speakers and attendees, 
      with the young StartUp nation atmosphere, to create a buzzing bustle of software engineers from around the globe. 
      And as usual, a hefty lunch, refreshing beer and plenty of coffee breaks spark the most interesting conversations 
      between colleagues and strangers alike.
